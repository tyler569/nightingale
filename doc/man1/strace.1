.TH STRACE 1 "2025" "Nightingale" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
strace \- trace system calls
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B strace
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.I command
.RI [ args ]...
.br
.B strace
.B \-p
.I PID
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B strace
enables kernel-level system call tracing for a command or process.
When tracing is enabled, every system call is logged to the kernel console
with its arguments and return value.
.PP
This is a simpler alternative to
.BR trace (1)
for basic system call monitoring, but requires kernel cooperation and
outputs to the kernel log rather than the terminal.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d
Disable syscall tracing (turn off tracing for a process).
.TP
.B \-f
Follow children - trace child processes created by fork/clone.
.TP
.BI "\-p " PID
Set tracing state for the specified process ID instead of executing
a new command.
.TP
.B \-h
Show help message.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B strace ls
Trace all system calls made by the ls command.
.TP
.B strace -f sh
Trace the shell and all child processes it spawns.
.TP
.B strace -p 42
Enable tracing for process 42.
.TP
.B strace -d -p 42
Disable tracing for process 42.
.SH NOTES
Unlike traditional strace, this tool outputs to the kernel console
(visible via serial output), not to stderr.
.PP
For interactive tracing with output to the terminal, use
.BR trace (1)
instead.

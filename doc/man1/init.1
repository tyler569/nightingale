.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /bin/init
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B init
is the first userspace process started by the Nightingale kernel.
It is responsible for initializing the system and spawning the shell.
.PP
The init process:
.IP \(bu 3
Runs as process ID 1
.IP \(bu
Spawns the shell (/bin/sh) and restarts it if it exits
.IP \(bu
Reaps orphaned child processes
.IP \(bu
Handles SIGCHLD to clean up zombie processes
.IP \(bu
Runs indefinitely until the system shuts down
.PP
When the shell exits (normally or by crashing), init automatically
restarts it, ensuring a shell is always available.

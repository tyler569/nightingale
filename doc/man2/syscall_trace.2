.TH SYSCALL_TRACE 2 "2025" "Nightingale" "Nightingale System Calls"
.SH NAME
syscall_trace \- enable or disable system call tracing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <unistd.h>
.PP
.BI "int syscall_trace(pid_t " pid ", int " state ");"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B syscall_trace()
enables or disables system call tracing for the process specified by
.IR pid .
.PP
When system call tracing is enabled, every system call made by the
traced process is logged to the kernel console with its arguments
and return value.
This is useful for debugging and understanding program behavior.
.PP
If
.I pid
is 0, the calling process is traced.
.PP
If
.I state
is non-zero, tracing is enabled.
If
.I state
is zero, tracing is disabled.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, returns the previous tracing state (0 if tracing was disabled,
non-zero if it was enabled).
On error, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B ESRCH
The process specified by
.I pid
does not exist.
.TP
.B EPERM
The calling process does not have permission to trace the specified process.
.SH NOTES
This is a simpler alternative to
.BR trace (2)
for basic system call monitoring.
It only logs syscalls to the kernel console and does not allow
inspection or modification of the traced process.

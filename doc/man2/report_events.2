.TH REPORT_EVENTS 2 "2025" "Nightingale" "Nightingale System Calls"
.SH NAME
report_events \- configure kernel event reporting
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <unistd.h>
.PP
.BI "int report_events(long " event_mask ");"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B report_events()
configures which kernel events should be reported to the kernel event log
for the calling process.
.PP
The
.I event_mask
argument is a bitmask specifying which event types to report.
Supported event types include:
.IP \(bu 3
System call entries and exits
.IP \(bu
Page faults
.IP \(bu
Context switches
.IP \(bu
Signal delivery
.IP \(bu
Process creation and termination
.PP
When an event type is enabled, occurrences of that event are logged
to the kernel event log, which can be read through the
.I /proc
filesystem or kernel console.
.PP
This is primarily a debugging and profiling interface.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, returns the previous event mask.
On error, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I event_mask
contains invalid event types.
.TP
.B EPERM
The calling process does not have permission to configure event reporting.
.SH NOTES
Enabling extensive event reporting can significantly impact system
performance due to logging overhead.
Use this feature judiciously in production systems.
